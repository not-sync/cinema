âš  Should not be used in production as is. Provided as a learning tool. Requires severe editing to the theme in order to use. Also, hasn't tested in the while. Use at own risk. Shopify mentions you can still use 1.0 themes: `can continue using a vintage theme if it meets their needs.`[ðŸ”—](https://shopify.dev/themes/os20)
